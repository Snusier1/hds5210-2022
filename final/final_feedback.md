# Feedback on Final

Generally great work on the final.  A few notes that could have made it even stronger:

1. Always remember to use variable names that help the reader (and you) understand what each variable represents.  Names like `data2` aren't helpful.
2. Your `decades()` function is a good idea, but the implementation wasn't very flexible.  What if something in the 2020s came in?
3. I thought the Year v. CVD Deaths chart was really interesting -- the continuous increase year over year. I wonder how that looks on a "per capita" basis? You later did some per capita analyiss, but not year-over-year.
4. I feel like you missed an opportunity to wrap things up with a final conclusion.

Good luck in the coming semesters!! Keep in touch.
